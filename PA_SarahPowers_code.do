For example, you should decide which// regression models you want to run and interpret, using the guidance below./* you can explore and describe the variables using commands such as summarize, tabulate, and correlate.  Note that some variables (e.g., level, function) are"string" variables, meaning they are text rather than numeric. The datasetalready contains numeric and/or dummy variables to represent these stringvariables in quantitative analyeses such as regressions. */summarizetabulate leveltabulate region functioncorr attainment level_num/* Note that only people in sales have an attainment score, which means thatthe attainment variable has a missing value for people in all other functions.This is as it should be, but it does mean that analyses involving the attainment variable will only include observations of sales people. Notethe different number of observations across the various pairwise correlationsfrom the following command: */pwcorr attainment level_num emailcount_int, sig obs/* You will want to use regression analyses to figure out whether emailcounts, meeting counts, and other variables are associated with salesattainment (using attainment as the outcome). */*regress attainment predictor1 predictor2 controlvar1 controlvar2 etc./* The models you test are up to you. As you see fit, you might viewhistograms, scatter, bysort, or related commands to explore variables, and relationships between variables. For example: */histogram centralityhistogram attainment, freqhistogram totalcount, freqscatter centrality totalcountbysort function: sum meetingcount_ext/* Note that the data are aggregated over a six month window. Note also thatsome people may have left or joined the company during this window, resultingin low values for some variables that may reflect a shorter time window. Thisshould not affect your core analyses. *//* A shortcut: if you want to include a sequence of controls in a regression, you can specify them as follows: */regress attainment totalcount leveldum2-leveldum7
